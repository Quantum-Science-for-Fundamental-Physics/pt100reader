This app follows a pipeline Model-View-Controller design pattern.

PyQt is event driven.

You do not call widgets within the main loop.

Events trigger signals being sent to slots. 

The SerialReader interacts with the Pico and collects data for us.

The DataWorkers run in the background and filter/store our data. 

The main window queries the dataworkers for data to show on it's graphs.
